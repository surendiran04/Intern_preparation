__builtin_clz(x) - leading zeros before the last set bit (64 bit calculation) for x=1 -> 63,x=2 ->62
__builtin_ctz(x) - trailing zeros after the first set bit (64 bit calculation) for x=1 -> 0,x=2 ->1,x=4 -> 2
__builtin_popcount(x) - No of set bits (64 bit calculation) for x=1 -> 1, x=5 ->2
 __builtin_parity(x)	Returns 1 if number of 1 bits is odd, else 0
